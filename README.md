The primary problem is to understand and predict user retention on an online learning platform. This involves analyzing various factors that influence a userâ€™s decision to continue or discontinue using the platform. The project requires a thorough investigation of the available data, which includes temporal variables, learner demographics, subscription details, and specialized domains. The challenge lies in dealing with null values, merging data, and understanding the relationships between different features. The problem involves applying machine learning techniques, specifically the CatBoost Classifier, to forecast user retention. The effectiveness of this model needs to be evaluated using validation set predictions and cross-validation. The project also involves interpreting the results obtained from the model. This includes understanding feature importance, analyzing the confusion matrix and learning curve, and visualizing high-importance features.
